# Device-Linearization-API

## Mdadm Library - Device Linearization API in C

Why use our Mdadm API?

Device Linearization: If you have multiple disk devices and you are worrying about memory management and storage capacity, this can be solved through our simple API that will linearize all your devicesâ€™ storage space.

Cache Functionality: Our querying capacity includes a cache functionality for a low-latency solution for reading and writing to your device spaces.

High Avalibility: We are running thousands of backup servers that will make you confident that the API functionalities we offer are highly reliable and always ready for usage. Our API has beyond-believable flexibility.

**API Functions:**

**mdadm_mount**
Parameters: none
Usage: Calling this function will mount all your devices. 
Potential Error: Calling mdadm_mount while already mounted returns an error
Return Type: -1 on fail, 1 on success.

**mdadm_unmount**
Parameters: none
Usage: Calling this function will unmount all your devices. 
Potential Error: Calling mdadm_unmount while not mounted returns an error
Return Type: -1 on fail, 1 on success.

**mdadm_read**
Parameters: 
uint32_t addr - The starting address across your devices to start reading from.
uint32_t len - The amount of bytes to be read starting at addr position.
uint8_t *buf - The content of the read bytes will be here after function call.
Usage: Calling this function will read len amount of bytes starting at the specified addr position, and then will put hte content to the buffer pointer.

An Error will be thrown if:
Devices are unmounted
The buffer pointer is NULL
len + addr is above maximum capacity ( currently: 1048576 bytes )
Len to be read is too large. ( too large is bigger than 1024 bytes )
Return Type: 0 if len is 0, -1 on failure, len on success.

**mdadm_write**
Parameters: 
uint32_t addr - The starting address across your devices to start writing from.
uint32_t len - The amount of bytes to be written from the starting address
uint8_t *buf - The content to be written into the devices.
Usage: Calling this function will write len bytes from buf starting at the address location specified by addr into the devices.
An Error will be thrown if:
Devices are unmounted
The buffer pointer is NULL
len + addr is above maximum capacity ( currently: 1048576 bytes )
Len to be read is too large. ( too large is bigger than 1024 bytes )
Return Type: 0 if len is 0, -1 on failure, len on success.

Additional Power Feature Functions

**mdadm_cache_create**
Parameters: 
int num_entries - The size of the cache you desire
Usage: Calling this function will dynamically add a cache system to speed up your querying.
An Error will be thrown if:  
You already have a cache created
Your cache size is less than two or bigger than 4096
Return Type: -1 on fail, 1 on success.


**mdadm_cache_destroy**
Parameters: none
Usage: Calling this function will free the dynamically allocated cache space and will delete the cache.
An Error will be thrown if:  
There is no cache currently active
Return Type: -1 on fail, 1 on success.


**mdadm_connect**
Parameters: 
const char *ip - The IP address in ASCII to connect to the server
uint16_t port - The port to be connected to the server.
Usage: Calling this function will connect to our highly reliable servers, ensuring that your calls will always come, even if world war three starts.
An Error will be thrown if:  
If the socket fails to create
If the sockaddr_in object failed to initialize
If it fails to connect to the server. ( ha, it will never happen! )
Return Type: A boolean false on failure, a boolean true on success

**mdadm_disconnect**
Parameters: none
Usage: When you wish to disconnect from our servers.
Return Type: VOID (none)

**API Example Usage**

#include <stdio.h>

// include our package at the top of the file after downloading
#include <mdadm.h>

int main()
{
    // Mount all devices
    mdadm_mount();
    
    // Define buffer to read into
    uint8_t read_buffer[1024];
    
    // Read 512 bytes starting at address 0 and put content into buffer
    mdadm_read(0, 512, read_buffer);
    
    // Define buffer to write from
    uint8_t write_buffer[1024] = "This test string will be written starting at byte 512.";
    
    // Write the buffer content starting at address 512
    mdadm_write(512, 512, write_buffer);
    
    // Unmount all devices
    mdadm_unmount();

    return 0;
}
